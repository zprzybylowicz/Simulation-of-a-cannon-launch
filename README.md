# Simulation-of-a-cannon-launch
Armata Simulation
This repository contains a 3D cannon launch simulation written in Julia. The simulation models the projectile's motion in space based on the explosive force of gunpowder and gravity. Users can select parameters such as the projectile mass, the degree of compaction of the gunpowder, its amount, and the launch angle. The simulation includes 3D modeling of both the explosion and the projectile's trajectory, with an option to view a 2D representation as well.

Features
-3D Visualization:

-Uses GLMakie to render the cannon, projectile, and explosion in a 3D scene.
Provides a realistic 3D model of the explosion and launch.
2D Visualization:

-Offers an additional 2D view of the projectile trajectory for simplified analysis.
Interactive Controls:

Slider: Adjusts the cannon's angle.
Textboxes: Allows the user to input:
Projectile Mass
Gunpowder Amount
Degree of Gunpowder Compaction
Button: Fires the cannon and triggers the simulation.
Physics Simulation:

Models the projectile’s motion based on the force generated by the gunpowder explosion and the effect of gravity.

Prerequisites
Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:

Julia
Required Julia packages:
GLMakie
FileIO
Colors
LinearAlgebra
You can install the required packages using Julia's package manager. 


Place the Cannon Mesh:

The simulation loads a cannon mesh from an OBJ file. Make sure the armata.obj file is located in a known directory. Update the file path in the code if necessary:

lufa_mesh = FileIO.load("path/to/armata.obj")
Running the Simulation
To run the simulation:

Open Julia in the repository directory.

Load the simulation file:

include("Przybyłowicz_Zuzanna_191342.jl")
The simulation window should open. Use the slider to adjust the cannon angle, enter the desired parameters in the textboxes, and click the "Wystrzel pocisk" button to fire the cannon.
